This repository is for the Model 68 Music Card originally produced by Newtech Inc in 1977,  The version I have is a recreation by Bob Applegate Corsham Technologies.  
I have a Corsham Technologies 6809 system (Backplane / 6809 CPU card / Serial card / Parallel Card / Disk Emulator Arduino to SD)  - this will require removing the parallel to test or 
a SS30 bus extension to run the music card.

My second system is a MSI (Midwest Scientific Instruments Chassis), with a GIMIX 6809 CPU card, 64 KB Electra DRAM card, SWTP serial card.  This has a custom monitor BUG and the SS30 port addressing is non standard.
but at least I have extra slots free on the SS30 bus.

First order of business is to build the replica Card.
