This repository is for the Model 68 Music Card originally produced by Newtech Inc in 1977,  The version I have is a recreation by Bob Applegate Corsham Technologies.  
I have a Corsham Technologies 6809 system (Backplane / 6809 CPU card / Serial card / Parallel Card / Disk Emulator Arduino to SD)  - this will require removing the parallel to test or 
a SS30 bus extension to run the music card.

My second system is a MSI (Midwest Scientific Instruments Chassis), with a GIMIX 6809 CPU card, 64 KB Electra DRAM card, SWTP serial card.  This has a custom monitor BUG and the SS30 port addressing is non standard.
but at least I have extra slots free on the SS30 bus.

First order of business is to build the replica Card.

I have OCR'd the NEWTECH, INC user guide.  I then recreated  the Text and corrected many of the OCR defects.  

The Basic program SCORE68 works ! I used teraterm (9600, added charachter delay 10 ms and carrage return delay 10 ms to get the paste to work reliably and at a visible speed to spot massive errors) 
to paste this into FLEX09 + BASIC935 running on my Corsham Tech 6809.  
After running the SCORE68 program the notes data for "The Entertainer" were put into memory and exiting to the monitor I was able to see the hex values present at the expected address. 
perhaps adding a PEEK subroutine to verify the values in memory would be worthwhile. 
also adding a user input to choose the memory location where the score is stored.
next to assemble the Play68 code for my system and io space. 

I found versions of score68b and play68b - the basic program (score68b) should be ok, but the assembly code (play68b) may need some cross assembly to work with a 6809 cpu.

Added some score file in txt file format - once these have been checked and processed with the SCORE.BAS program I will add code to the bottom of the text.  possibly even S19 files.
